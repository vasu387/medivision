    <p><b>Spiritual meditation is an experience that takes you to the depths of who you are. You, as your real self, stripped of all the perceptions you had about yourself until that point in your life. In the process, you experience joy and peace. A feeling of love and light warms up your being.Spiritual meditation makes you realize the eternal truth and let go of all that had happened and will happen. The present is where you want to be and find solace in. The need to practice spiritual meditation comes from an innate longing to see and think beyond the chaotic world surrounding you.

    <h1>Advantages</h1>
    <p><b>Spirituality can promote close family and friendship bonds and help people cope with physical or emotional pain and other life stressors. It can also offer people a strong sense of community, particularly for those who are part of a spiritual group or community.
    Meditation not only benefits the mind, but also revives the soul. We often feel relentless and stressed from the busy lifestyle we are living these days. Therefore, meditation is a perfect way for you to live a life free of stress and combat your own demons.

    <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
    <p><b>Although some view it as a mental and emotional tool, meditation has proven physical effects on the body. Subjects in the 2017 study say they felt negative changes all throughout their systems, including pain, pressure, involuntary movements, headaches, fatigue, weakness, gastrointestinal problems, and dizziness.
