        <p><b>Focus meditation, also known as focused attention meditation (FAM), is a type of mindfulness meditation that can help increase your awareness of the present moment. Rather than attempt to empty the mind, this meditation style involves focusing your attention on an object or physical sensation, such as your breathing. Itâ€™s a great meditation technique for beginners as it does not require a meditation practitioner or any previous training. However, non-meditators might find it easier to get started with guided meditations via meditation apps. All you need to begin experiencing the positive effects of meditation is a few minutes, a quiet space, and an object of focus.</b>

        <h1>Advantages</h1>
        <p><b>Reduced stress: Meditation may decrease stress. It can also improve  symptoms of stress-related conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and fibromyalgia.
Improved memory: Better focus through regular meditation may increase memory and mental clarity. These benefits can help fight age-related memory loss and dementia.
Increased attention: Meditation helps with attention span, allowing you to stay focused longer.
Enhanced willpower: Meditation develops the mental discipline needed to avoid unhelpful habits.
Better sleep: Meditation can shorten the time it takes to fall asleep and improve sleep quality.
Less pain: Meditation can reduce pain and boost emotion regulation. Together with medical care, this may help treat chronic pain.
Lower blood pressure: Blood pressure decreases during meditation and over time in people who meditate regularly. This can reduce strain on the heart and blood vessels and help prevent heart disease.</b></p>
<h1>Disadvantages</h1>
<p><b>The primary disadvantage of mediation is that it cannot always ensure an outcome that is favorable to both parties. Because the mediator is not an impartial decision-maker, it can be difficult to enforce the terms of an agreement in the event that one or both parties do not comply with the terms they have agreed to.
Not compulsory;
Concerns exist around the enforceability of a mediation agreement;
All parties must agree to a resolution as the result is not guaranteed;
Can be difficult if either party are withholding information;
Mediation may not be appropriate if one of the parties required public disclosure
