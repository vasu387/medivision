        <p><b>Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a technique for avoiding distracting thoughts and promoting a state of relaxed awareness.According to supporters of TM, when you meditate, the ordinary thinking process is “transcended.” It’s replaced by a state of pure consciousness. In this state, you achieve perfect stillness, rest, stability, order, and a complete absence of mental boundaries. The end goal is to achieve a state of relaxed awareness.

The method became popular due to its association with the Beatles, but TM continues to be studied and practiced today for its health benefits.</b></p>
