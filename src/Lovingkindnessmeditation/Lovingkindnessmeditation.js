        <p><b>We'll now shift into this practice of joy, by bringing to mind someone who we really believe has our best interests in their heart. Someone who has extended kindness and support to us. This could be someone we know now or someone from the past. A friend, family member, teacher, colleague. 

Choose just one person and bring them to mind as though they were seated right in front of you. Smiling at you. 

Imagine them truly wishing for you to be happy, fulfilled. For you to have a life that is flourishing. Imagine them beaming this towards you in their smile, in their eyes. And with your next breaths, inhale and draw in that intention of goodness. </b></p>

Decreased Marital Conflict.Studies show that loving-kindness meditation helps in reducing self-critical thoughts and behaviors. By directing compassionate feelings towards oneself, individuals can create a mental environment where negative self-judgment is replaced by self-acceptance and kindness. This can gradually improve your self-esteem.There was something I could do. I could practice loving-kindness meditation each day, as many times as I felt called to. I knew intimately just how powerful practicing loving-kindness could be. I had recently spent a year meditating with loving-kindness phrases, and had unexpectedly healed deep wounds within myself.
Decreased Anger.In progressive muscle relaxation, you focus on slowly tensing and then relaxing each muscle group.

This can help you focus on the difference between muscle tension and relaxation. You can become more aware of physical sensations.

In one type of progressive muscle relaxation, you start to tense and relax the muscles in your toes. You gradually work your way up to your neck and head. This is best done in a quiet area without interruptions. You also can start with your head and neck and work down to your toes. Tense your muscles for about five seconds and then relax for 30 seconds, and repeat.</b></p>
